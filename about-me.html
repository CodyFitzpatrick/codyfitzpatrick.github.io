		<p class="am-p">Born and raised in South Florida, USA, I have been acclimated to a busy lifestyle since day one. Growing up, I was nearly-obsessed with anything related to computers, including video games. I can remember viewing web pages’ source code, editing it, and saving it to my desktop, thinking I was a clever hacker (for those who don’t know, it doesn’t do anything). While my father, an all-things-real-estate consultant, spoke business in the background, I listened and quietly developed my skills not only as a programmer, but as a business professional as well.</p>
		<p class="am-p">I maintained an interest in programming throughout my early years, but waited until high school to actually produce a product, which in this case was an automotive-related web magazine (*a blog*), complete with a custom-skinned YouTube channel. Having found solid footing and a desire for a greater online presence, I created other websites, but to no avail. While my first site managed to pay for itself – cover the expenses of its hosting and maintenance – a few times over, my new additions failed to reach the small success of the first; none of them achieved the widespread success I had hoped. Yet, I had learned a valuable lesson: You shouldn’t chase money. Instead, follow your passion, and if you are passionate enough about what you are doing, the money will come due to your high interest and skill level.</p>
		<p class="am-p">Today, I am a student, not only acquiring a degree from a traditional university, but learning real-time, through both self-education and real-world experiences. Rather than share my exact tactics for success, I will share widely-applicable lessons that I have learned in both business and web technologies. Hopefully, my tips and tricks will assist you in your own endeavors. As always, If you wish to contact me for any reason, please do so by visiting my contact me page. What are you waiting for? Start learning today!</p>
